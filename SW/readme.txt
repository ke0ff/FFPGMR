This is a Tiva TM4C123GH6PM Project, bare-metal, CLI-based programmer engine that communicates via a UART-serial (USB-COM port) terminal emulator.
The CCS6 base-project is zipped, then source files are committed daily as work progresses. Unzip the archive, then place all of the individual
source-file commits into the appropriate folder (replacing the existing source files).
